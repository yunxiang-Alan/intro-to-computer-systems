# uchicago-cs154-project
This is the repository for my work in UChicago CMSC 15400 Introduction to Computer Systems, which is modeled after a course with the same name at CMU. There are five projects for this course (Bitmanip, Bomb, Cache, Shell, Malloc), while this repository includes four of these projects. **Please note that the original purpose of this repository is for recording & collection; it is not allowed to copy any part of code in this repo for your own CS 154 coursework.**        

Description:
- Bitmanip  
- Cache  
- Shell  
- Malloc
