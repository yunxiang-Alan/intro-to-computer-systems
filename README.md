# intro-systems-project
This is the repository for my work in UChicago CS 154 Introduction to Computer Systems, which is modeled after a course with the same name at CMU. There are five projects for this course (Bitmanip, Bomb, Cache, Shell, Malloc), while this repository includes four of them.             

## Description
* Bitmanip  
* Cache: a basic cache simulator    
* Shell: a basic Unix shell
* Malloc: a basic dynamic memory allocator implemented with explicit list  

## Scores
| Project     | Score       |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| bitmanip    | 100         |
| bomb        | 100         |
| cache       | 100         |
| shell       | 100         |
| malloc      | 98          |

Note: my malloc project is implemented with a well-tuned explicit free list; to achieve a score higher than 98 the use of segregated free list is required.
