# uchicago-cs154-project
This is the repository for my work in UChicago CMSC 15400 Introduction to Computer Systems, which is modeled after a course with the same name at CMU. There are five projects for this course (Bitmanip, Bomb, Cache, Shell, Malloc), while this repository includes four of these projects. If you have a question regarding any part of the projects, feel free to send me an email at qizhengz at uchicago dot edu.          

Description:
- Bitmanip  
- Cache: a basic cache simulator    
- Shell: a basic Unix shell
- Malloc: a basic dynamic memory allocator implemented with explicit list
