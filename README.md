# uchicago-cs154-project
This is the repository for my work in UChicago CMSC 15400 Introduction to Computer Systems, which is modeled after a course with the same name at CMU. There are five projects for this course (Bitmanip, Bomb, Cache, Shell, Malloc), while this repository includes four of these projects.             

Description:
- Bitmanip  
- Cache: a basic cache simulator    
- Shell: a basic Unix shell
- Malloc: a basic dynamic memory allocator implemented with explicit list  

Scores:
| Project     | Score       |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| bitmanip    | 100         |
| bomb        | 100         |
| cache       | 100         |
| shell       | 100         |
| malloc      | 98          |
