# uchicago-cs154-project
This is the repository for my work in CMSC 15400, Introduction to Computer Systems, which is modeled after a course with the same name at CMU. There are five projects for this course (Bitmanip, Bomb, Cache, Shell, Malloc).    

This repository includes four of these projects:  
- Bitmanip  
- Cache  
- Shell  
- Malloc
